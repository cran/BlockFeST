Description: An R implementation of an extension of the 'BayeScan' software (Foll, 2008) <DOI:10.1534/genetics.108.092221> for codominant markers, adding the option to group individual SNPs into pre-defined blocks. A typical application of this new approach is the identification of genomic regions, genes, or gene sets containing one or more SNPs that evolved under directional selection.
